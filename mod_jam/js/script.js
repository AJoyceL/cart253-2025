/**
 * Mod Jam
 * Joyce Angelina Lam
 * 
 * This is my mod jam submission!
 * 
 * TO DO:
 * - TITLE SCREEN: title + instructions > start with spacebar/activating by catching your first fly
 * 
 * - GAME OVER SCREEN: timer runs out and didn't catch enough flies
 * 
 * - WIN SCREEN: congratulations for completing all levels
 * 
 * - TIMER: countdown timer for limiting the game time
 * 
 *  - SCORING SYSTEM: points for catching flies, points deducted for hitting enemies
 * > ENEMIES: flies that deduct points when hit
 * 
 * - NEW MOVEMENT: frog moves by keyboard (WASD or arrow keys) + flies moves randomly (look up different movement types)
 * 
 * - NEW AUDIO/VISUAL EFFECTS: new sound effects for catching flies, hitting enemies, launching tongue, background music
 * 
 * POSSIBLY:
 *  * - multiple levels: each level has a   different goal and time limit (if possible + different backgrounds and music)
 * - health system: lose health when you hit an enemy, gain health when you catch a fly?
 *  * - different types of flies: some are worth more points, some move faster, some move in different patterns
 * - different types of enemies: some take more than one hit to defeat, some move faster, some move in different patterns
