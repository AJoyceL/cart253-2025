At first glance, I was struck by the blend of retro aesthetics and strong programming in Camelia’s project. The juxtaposition of pixel-style visuals with a myth-inspired concept made the work stand out. I especially noticed her inclusion of two game variations, extending beyond the base design to personalise the experience. Despite the script’s brevity, it was clear and well annotated, helping future readers understand each section.
Though the two modes share core mechanics, their contrasting visuals evoke different emotions—intrigue, awe, or curiosity. The pixel-art backgrounds and objects, such as coins and prophecies, were detailed and vibrant without overwhelming the gameplay.
Additionally, her use of AI-generated art felt purposeful and well integrated. It streamlined her workflow and inspired me to consider a similar approach for the Variation Jam.
Overall, I was genuinely impressed by both the project’s scope and striking visual.

At first glance, Jason’s Mod Jam appears clean and simple, but a closer look reveals a refreshing mix of minimal visuals and modern, Gen Z meme audio familiar from TikTok or YouTube Shorts. 
While the project initially seems visually straightforward, the script shows more technical depth than I expected.  The flies, for instance, move along sine and cosine paths and reset at random positions through layered if and else-if conditions. The shift from key-pressed to mouse-pressed controls for the tongue was also a clever choice, ensuring it consistently launches towards the cursor no matter the frog’s position.
The inclusion of multiple levels adds incentive to keep playing—even if I haven’t passed level one yet. From the script, it’s clear Jason introduced obstacles in later stages to increase difficulty and expand interactivity.
In general, I liked how modern, engaging, and unexpectedly complex the project turned out to be.

From the start, Ya Xuan’s project stands out for its whimsical charm, but what really impressed me was the layer of difficulty added through days/levels and a health bat. While I haven't reaches past two flies, I saw that each stages introduces new difficulty - needing to feed every three seconds, avoiding birds that reduce health but feeds the frog and adjusting to the different fly behaviours - making the game feel dynamic and progressively challenging, but it isn’t difficult for difficult’s sake, it gives it a sense of rhythm and growth whenever you pass a day. The need for a rhythmic success and survival is clever, adding to the unpredictability of the game.
The visuals, with the soft animated water and gentle environment, contrast nicely with the increasing pressure. I also found the fading sky - the gradual change from day to night - and the lowering sun as a timer surprisingly immersive and fitting for the theme of days. 
What really stands out, is the care she put in the script. It may be long and heavy, but the detailed comments who a clear intention and thoughtful design process.
