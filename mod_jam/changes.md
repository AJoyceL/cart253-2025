## HERE ARE THE CHANGES AND MODIFICATION I MADE TO THE PROJECT

> Visual/Audio
    - I added different audios to the title, game, win and lose(game over) screen.
    - I added a monarch butterfly(orange circle) as an enemy.
    - I added a superfly that gives twice the point of a fly.
    - I changed the frog to a bat (rather than launchign a tongue, the bat springs forward to catch the flies).
    - changed the background from morning to night with stars(taken from the starfield project).

> Gameplay
    - The bat moves by pressing down on the left and right arrow or the A and D key.
    - Spacebar is used to start the game as well as launching the tongue.
    - I added a paddle(bird) that blocks the bat and forces it backwards when hit/overlap.

> Movement
    - The fly, superfly and butterfly move on a sine and cosine line respectively => reference from p5 : https://p5js.org/examples/angles-and-motion-sine-cosine/
    - The paddle moves randomly(I took the code from the Frogfrogfrog project fly movement).

> State
    - There is a title screen => a game screen => a win and lose screen.
