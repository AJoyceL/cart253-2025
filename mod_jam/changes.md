## HERE ARE THE CHANGES AND MODIFICATION I MADE TO THE PROJECT

> Visual/Audio
    - I added different audios to the title, game, win and lose(game over) screen.
    - I added a monarch butterfly(orange circle) as an enemy.

> Gameplay
    - The frog moves by pressing down on the left and right arrow or the A and D key.
    - Spacebar is used to start the game as well as launching the tongue.

> Movement
    - The fly and butterfly move on a sine and cosine line respectively.

> State
    - There is a title screen => a game screen => a win and lose screen.
