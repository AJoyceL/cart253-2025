    - Intention clear with the shaky/trembling music notes and headphones on the character. 
    - The figure/self portrait is all smooth lines and impressive in execusion to make it
    - the way she used vertex, used beginShape(TRIANGLE_STRIP).
    - interesting use of mousepressed and X and Y for the interaction.
    - Different how she used a different style, putting everything in the function draw, I find it a bit clustered to put everyhting in a single place, rather than have it sepereated into it's own thing, but it seems to work for her perfectly well. It made her js short and concise for such a detailed project.
    - It was probanly just me, but I had to look at the code to figure out the interactive aspect was triggered by holding the mouse down and moving it.

    - The cute design calls out to me, rather playful in it's concept.
    - the little flowers that spin as the mouse moves is a small but eyecatching act, follows the mouseX and mouseY, and turns into snowballs as the background changes to a cooler tone, mimicking the change in season(spring and winter). 
    - Subtle shift of background colour, it chnages slowly and not a rapid shift.
    - ingenius in the way she used ellipses to draw the curls rather than vertexes.
    interesting how she used Math.PI to draw the eyes and mouth, I would have expected to use a arcs, but this is an interesting approuch to it.
    - while the js script is super long, everyhting is so well organised that it's easy to find whatever function I'm looking for and trying to understand.
    - interactiveness easy to understand

    - Pixel art is rather refreshing to look at when every project has more smooth surfaces. stands out by itself with it's minimalistic design but as interesting and interactable as other projects.
    - from what iunderstand, she used constraints to limit the eye movement, a simpler approach to it than mine with maps and offsetX.
    - everything it typed into a single functions, so I find it a bit confusing and clustered, but her script is so clean that I can find everyhting I need with a quick scroll or getting lost.
    - I like that she made the background change from ngiht tot day with a timer. 
    - interactiveness easy to understand.
