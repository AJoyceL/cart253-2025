    > My initial impression of her project was awe, I was struck by the clear and aesthetical design that reminded me a lot of album covers –something I find rather fitting for the musical theme of her project. 
    > What first stood out to me was the impressive execution of her portrait using multiple 2D shapes (ellipse, rect, triangle, arc, line and vertex) that resulted to such a smooth and synchronous figure. Especially her use of vertex() and (TRIANGLE_STRIP) to shape the unicorn horn in different colours and segments (first base-188, second base-211 and third base-230). 
    > I also found it interesting that Nerly used mouseDragged() and mousePressed() for the interactive aspect of her art jam, and while I thought it rather innovative, it took me a few seconds to understand that (or it could’ve just been me having a hard time).
    > Overall, her work was beautiful, but the singular thing that I had an issue with was how clustered her function draw() was. Having everything written directly into a single function instead of spreading it apart into different ones for a clean and clear script.

    > At first glance, I was struck by how cute and playful her Art Jam was in it’s concept, from the surprising curls in the hair to the rotating flowers and the background transition.
    > The first thing that caught my attention was the portrait itself, with it’s soft curves and round surfaces. When looking at her script, I found it ingenious that she hadn’t used a single vertex, but rather ellipses and arcs to draw it in completion. Using const variables for the portrait and the inclusion of Math.PI to draw the arc of the eyes and mouth isn’t something I know of, but it is remarkable.
    > Following that, I observed the slow colour transition of the background and the rotating flowers that turned into snowballs, both of which are triggered by mouseX. I saw that she used a map() and constraint to make the transition smooth and subtle, unlike my own project. It is something I found noteworthy. 
    > In general, I liked her project, the combination of her creative coding and the clean separation of her functions and variables made it an engaging experience.

    > Right away, I felt that Camelia’s Art Jam was refreshing to look at when every other project I’d seen had a smooth and crisp. It stands out by itself for it’s simple but interesting design that is reminiscent of NFTs. 
    > From what I can see, the portrait itself was built in a single function, using fills and rectangles to draw it out. It is a bit overwhelming to look at, but the shortness of her script made it easy to find what I need. Within it, she used a constraint and variables to make the eyes follow the mouseX and mouseY –or from what I understand. Her approach to limiting the movement range was easier to understand and simpler to do than mine. Adding to that, I found the movement exceptionally sleek, especially with the highlight shifting as it followed the cursor.
    > In addition, the interactive aspect of the portrait built on mouseClicked was small, but stood out within the background that switches between a dark and light blue on a short timer.
    > In total, I found the refreshingly original approach of her work cool by the collection of easy to understand coding and minimalistic, interaction aspects.
