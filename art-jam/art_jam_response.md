    > My initial impression of her project was one of awe, I was struck by the clear and aesthetically pleasing design that immediately evoked an album cover art, which I found fitting given the musical theme she explored.
    > What stood out to me was the technically impressive execution of her self-portrait using multiple 2D shapes (such as ellipse, rect, triangle, arc, line and vertex points) that resulted to such a smooth figure. Her use of vertex() and (TRIANGLE_STRIP) to shape the unicorn horn in different colours and segments (first base-line 188, second base-line 211 and third base-line 230) was particularly noteworthy. 
    > I found the interactive element, triggered through mousePressed() and mouseDragged(), to be a creative shift to the usual mouseX and mouseY, and while I thought it was innovative, it wasn't immediately intuitive what the interaction was. It may point to a need for a clearer user cue, or that might have just been me that was struggling.
    > Overall, her work was both technically and creatively rich, but the only thing that I had an issue with was how clustered her function draw() was. Having nearly all visual logic written directly into a single function instead of spreading it apart can make debugging or future expansion difficult, as well as the readability of her script.

    > At first glance, I was struck by the playful and whimsical nature of her Art Jam. The unexpected curls in the hair, the rotating flowers, and the smooth background transition all contributed to a sense of charm and creativity that feklt delberate.
    > The first thing that caught my attention was the portrait itself, with it’s soft curves and round surfaces. When looking at her script, I found it clever that she avoided using any vertex() points, instead relying on ellipses and arcs to construct it. Her use of const variables and Math.PI to draw the arc of the eyes and mouth revealed that she had put effort in her project.
    > Following that,I obsevred that the background transition and the rotating flowers(which turned into snowballs) responded smoothly to mouseX. I appreciate how she used a map() and constraint() to make the control the timing and fluidity of these chnages, compared to my more abrupt/rough approach to it.
    > In general, I liked her project for the clean structure and creative flair. The seperation of functions and variables was well organised, which made her code readable and easier to touch-up on in the future if she were to add to it.

    > Right away, I felt that Camelia’s Art Jam was refreshing to look at for it's bold simplicity and geometric style, reminicent of an NFT.
    > From what I can see, the portrait itself was built in a single function, using fills and rectangles to draw a unique portrait. While the structure was a bit overwhelming, the briefness of her code made it easy to navigate. Within it, her use of constraint() to control the eye movment, mapped by mouseX and mouseY, was particularly effective. Her approach to limiting the movement range was easier to understand and simpler to do than mine. Adding to that, I found the movement exceptionally sleek, especially with the highlight shifting as it followed the cursor.
    > In addition, the second interactive element of the portrait, the appearance of golden jewelery that responded to mouseClicked(), subtly stood out within the background that switches between a dark and light blue on a short timer.
    > That said, though minimal, every element felt intentional, it made me reflect on how simplicity, when well executed, can have just as much of an impact as a more complex project. It was a refreshingly original piece.
